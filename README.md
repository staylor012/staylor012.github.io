# Computer Programmer

## About Me

I’m an aspiring software developer with a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Cal State San Marcos and hands-on experience in both technology and education. My background includes early-career work in network operations and several years as a substitute teacher and instructional aide, where I learned to communicate clearly, solve problems creatively, and adapt quickly.

Now I’m focused on transitioning into software development. I’m expanding my skills in C++, Python, and Java, and I’m especially interested in creating practical tools and solutions that make a difference. When I’m not coding or learning new tech, you’ll probably find me on the golf course or planning my next trip.
